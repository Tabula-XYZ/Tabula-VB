Source code of the virtual browser used by tabula.xyz (Tabula VB)

## Why open source ?
For privacy reasons we chose to not signed the app we created (as Apple and Windows forces you to reveal your identity if you want to sign your application).
BUT when you choose not signing a software, it will thus be detected as a potential danger (virus).
<br />
So the code of the app is accessible to you, so you can verify there is no virus.
